# üé• Real-Time Face Detection System

> This project is a submission for the **Viksit Bharat Buildathon üáÆüá≥**

A comprehensive face detection and recognition system built in Python. This tool can identify and process faces from static images, pre-recorded videos, and live webcam feeds.

---

## üåü Key Features

* **Image Mode:** Analyzes a static image file, detects all faces, and saves the cropped faces to the `output/` directory.
* **Video Mode:** Processes a video file (like `.mp4`), performing face detection on every frame and outputting a new video with detection boxes.
* **Live Mode:** Uses your computer's webcam to perform real-time face detection and recognition.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **OpenCV** (for image and video processing)
* **TensorFlow / Keras** (for the deep learning model)
* **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (for development and demonstration)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

You must have Python 3.10 or higher and `pip` installed.

### 2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AshiteshSingh/RealTimeFaceDetection_DeepLearning.git](https://github.com/AshiteshSingh/RealTimeFaceDetection_DeepLearning.git)
    cd RealTimeFaceDetection_DeepLearning
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Running the Project

1.  Open the project in VS Code (or your preferred editor).
2.  Launch the `DL.ipynb` notebook.
3.  Run the cells in order.
4.  You can change the `MODE` variable at the top of the notebook to `'IMAGE'`, `'VIDEO'`, or `'LIVE'` to test the different features.
